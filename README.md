# Welcome

Hi! My name is Steve Carmichael and this my home on GitHub. Below are some of the private projects I have been working on, or have in the past, many which are not published on this page.  Two projects I am excited about are:

# RunClubPro
(work in progress, not in production) 

**RunClubPro™** is a SaaS app that helps running club organizers manage club operations. The front-end is built in React/Next.js and communicates to a backend via Rest APIs implemented using Java, Spring Boot, Spring Security, JPA, and Postgres. Deployment to AWS pending. 

***Features:***

 - Member management (member enrollment, search, attendance tracking, etc)
 - Event management (club events, races, etc)
 - Club dues/fees payments via Stripe, Paypal (one time fee and subscription)
 - Club notifications (email, text)
 - Documentation management (waivers, emergency contact forms, etc)
 

# TesseraSoft *Impact™*
(work in progress - not in production)

In art, a *tessera* is a small, individual piece (stone, tile, etc.) used to create the overall picture or design known as a mosaic.  

In business, our *tessera* represents a set of small, independent building blocks that solve your small to mid-size non-profit or social enterprises problems of managing marketing, member management, events, donors, fundraising, event planning, documentation management and more. Pick and choose the services you need and have them available in a single, unified dashboard.  Only pay for features you use.

This reduces your cost, complexity and dependence on needing numerous, highly disjointed software products or custom development to pull your data from numerous sources.
